# StS2 Dev Console — Commands Reference

Decompiled from `sts2.dll` (publicized). Every command here lives in `MegaCrit.Sts2.Core.DevConsole.ConsoleCommands.*ConsoleCmd` and is registered at runtime.

## Opening the Console

Press one of: `` ` `` (backtick) · `~` (tilde) · `*` · `'`

Type `help` inside the console for the in-game list. Tab autocompletes.

## Syntax Conventions

- `<arg>` — required
- `[arg]` — optional
- `type:name` — expected type
- `a|b` — choose one literal
- **Screaming snake case** for IDs: `BODY_SLAM`, `ENTROPIC_BREW` (not `Body Slam`).
- **Networked** commands sync to all MP peers; non-networked run on the local instance only.

## Built-ins (handled by `NDevConsole` itself)

| Command | Effect |
|---|---|
| `clear` | Clears console buffer |
| `exit` | Closes the console overlay |

### `log` Enum Values (source of truth: decompile output)

`log <type> <level>` — the valid types are `LogType` enum members; levels are `LogLevel` enum members. Run `log` with no args or a wrong value to see both lists printed by the game.

## Targeting Cheatsheet for `block` / `damage` / `kill` / `power`

Target indices are positions in `CombatState.Creatures`:
- `0` — player
- `1+` — enemies in spawn order

Example:
```
block 30 1       # 30 block on first enemy
damage 9999 1    # murder first enemy
power WEAK 3 1   # apply 3 Weak to first enemy (ID must exist)
```

## Useful Combos for Combat Log Mod Testing

Test damage-received UI:
```
block 30 1       # enemy gets 30 block
draw 5           # more cards to burn
energy 10        # more plays
```
Then attack. Combat Log should show `-HP` + `(30 blocked)` + skull on kill.

Test sourceless damage:
```
damage 5 0       # 5 damage to player, no dealer
```
Should render without source prefix in the row.
